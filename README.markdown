Kanban Me

This is my first crack at building a web app using rails (or any programming language for that matter).  I work as a BA/PM in an agile dev environment all day so decided to make my first app an agile/kanban board for tracking stories or anything I want to post on there.

I am getting my guidance from Michael Hartl's excellent raultutorial.org site, and good old grandfather Google.
